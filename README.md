# Chicken Invaders Game (OpenGL)

This project is a simple OpenGL-based game inspired by "Chicken Invaders" or "Space Invaders." The player controls a spaceship and must shoot chickens while avoiding their eggs. The game features moving chickens, bullets, and health management.

## Features
- **Spaceship Control**: Move left and right using the 'A' and 'D' keys.
- **Shooting**: Fire bullets using the spacebar.
- **Chickens**: Chickens move left or right across the screen and drop eggs.
- **Health & Score**: Avoid eggs to maintain health and gain points by shooting chickens.
- **Textures**: Background, spaceship, chickens, eggs, and bullets use OpenGL textures.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when your health reaches zero, or when all chickens are defeated.
